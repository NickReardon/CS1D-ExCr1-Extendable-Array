    Implement the vector ADT by means of an extendable array 
(expands dynamically) used in a circular fashion, so that 
insertions and deletions at the beginning and end run in constant 
time.  Print the circular array before and after each insertion and 
deletion.  Insertions and deletion that are not at the beginning or 
end will run in O(n) time.  Test the vector ADT methods (inserts, 
deletes, size, isEmpty, etc.).  The initial array size is 4. Print out 
the index (rank) of the array with the corresponding value.

Do not use the <vector> STL.

    Use the following data:

    Insert 14, 5, 4, 1, 21, 33, 12, 8
    Delete 14
    Delete 1
    Insert 9 at the front of the vector
    Insert 7 after 33
    Insert 44 at the end of the vector
